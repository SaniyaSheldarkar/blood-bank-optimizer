# Blood Bank Optimizer 🩸

A simple, browser-based mini-project that lets users **register as blood donors** and **request blood** from those registered—all using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with `localStorage`.

---

## 🔍 Features

- **Donor Registration:** Enter name, contact, blood group, and city; data persists via browser `localStorage`.  
- **Blood Request:** Select any blood group (or “All”) and city to instantly list matching donors registered earlier.  
- **Dynamic UI:** Responsive forms switch between “Register” and “Request” views; results render dynamically.  
- **Offline Persistence:** All donor data remains across page reloads and browser restarts.
